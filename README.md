# Third-Lesson
Continue self-taught route until College Degree classes begin. Already enrolled and registered. Waiting game now. In the meantime I will further my skill set with self-taught course work.

## Description:
Begin the third lesson with advanced CSS properties. Work with the box model, understand how to use the flexbox and work with boot strap. 

## Breakdown:

* Begin with opening the new repository in github. Clone into desktop
* Create the html file and the css file
* Begin the lesson with fonts. Size, weight, family and etc.
* Learn how to link font-family from external source. How to write them in css
* Begin box model. Learning about padding, margin, border, and more
* Create a second html page and a second css stylesheet for the box model
* Create links for both the first and second web page
* Perform the tic-tac-toe board challenge to better understand the positioning. (NOTE: you can apply two classes by class="first-name second-name"- just add the space do not add commas)
* Clean up HTML and CSS. Apply all comments and commit. 
* Last step. Research/ Look up how to center the entire table in the web page. (NOTE: What we found was margin: auto; which will become responsive with the page when resizing the web browser)
* using the css properties that we have learned, center all the content without changing previous css.
